# G4J
Efficient Generics for Java (uses a preprocessor to allow generic algorithms that use primitives). It is highly useful for generating generic code that makes use of primitives, especially primitive arrays.

**WARNING:** Please use this library with care. It can open Pandora's box ;)

We are waiting for project [valhalla](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/)...
